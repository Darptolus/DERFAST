    "## Thinking in parallel\n",
    "If you're experienced in sequential programming, you're likely familiar with writing code for a single thread. When thinking sequentially, the developer must primarly think of the instructions that are executed. Parallel programming adds an additional complexity to the development program. When writting programs, a developer must think of the following aspects of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Workers creation: How to create workers and how many to create\n",
    "Work assignment: How to assign work to different workers\n",
    "Workers/resources communication and coordination: How workers communicate and synchronize in order to coordinate their work.\n",
    "Note: Different programming models exist that balance these three tasks. Here I am referring to the most popular programming models. Allow me to be simplistic here.\n",
    "The fork-join model - An example.\n",
    "OpenMP is mainly known for its Fork-Join model. Programs execute with an initial sequential thread until a directive (code anotation) is reached that initiates parallel threads (workers). Different directives are used to assign work to these threads. At the end of the parallel region, threads synchronize, forming again a single thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above example. worker creation is achieved through the #pragma omp parallel num_threads(10) directive. It allows to create 10 threads. Each worker is associated with an identifier, obtained through the omp_get_thread_num() function call. Work assignment is achieved through the code in the region enclosed by the brackets {...}. All threads are executing the same set of instructions, in this case only printf(\"hello from thread %d\\n\",...);. Notice that having a different identifier allows for each thread to access different data, or follow different paths. Finally Worker synchronization and coordination is relatively simple in this example, since there's not much communication between them. However, at the end of the parallel region, all workers must wait for each other to finish before continuing with the sequential code."

If you're running this in a machine that has multiple threads, I expect you to see a number less than 10000. Moreover, multiple executions may lead to different results. This is what is known as a data race. It occurs because reading i, incrementing, and writting to i are three different instructions. Therefore, it is possible for two threads to write the same value of i, increment it and obtain the same value twice.\n",

    "So far we have discussed what happens to variables when going from a sequential region to a parallel region. However, what happens to these multiple private memory locations when a parallel region is over? In principle, private variables are discarded (freed) at the end of a parallel region, hence, if their value are important, it is necessary to store them into a shared location that lives after the parallel region. Yet, it is often desireable to update the original memory location of the variable.\n",

    "But wait, all of these variables may have different values. How do I decide what's the final value to be used after the parallel region? Reductions are collective operations that aggregate the different values into a single value, by applying an operation. Ideally, this operation should be commutative, otherwise, how do I decide the order in which they are applied?\n",
