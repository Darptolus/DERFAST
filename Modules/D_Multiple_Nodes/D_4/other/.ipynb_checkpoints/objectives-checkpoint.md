# C and C++

## Course objectives:

- Introduce C/C++ syntax for simple I/O and variable types and declaration
- Show how to compile and link C/C++ programs
- Present the systax fo control statements (loops, conditional expressions) and function declaration in C/C++
- Introduce Class decplaration and ussage in C++
- Introduce preprocessor directives
- Show how to use Make and CMake to build applications
- Present the concept of pointers and their ussage in dynamic memory allocation

## Learning outcomes:

- Write and compile programs in C/C++
- Declare variables and functions in C/C++
- Use control statements in C/C++
- Use CMake tool to build C/C++ applications
- Use preprocessor directives to include libraries and other simple tasks
