To compile the programs, run "make".

Note: The Makefile assumes mpicc is the compile script for MPI
programs and that it is in your default path. If not, edit the
Makefile appropriately.

The programs stencil_mpi_ddt_funneled.c and stencil_mpi_ddt_multiple.c
need an OpenMP-enabled compiler.

You can run any of the "stencil" programs as follows:

mpiexec -n 4 ./stencil_mpi 100 1 200 2 2

You can run ga_mpi_ddt_rma as follows:

mpiexec -n 16 ./ga_mpi_ddt_rma 100 25 4 4
